# Getting Started with Amplify CLI
This directory was generated by [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli) and modified by Jxgarci.

Added resources for the devopment of the backend: 
- Function folder: contains folders for the Lambda Functions deployed:
    - LexHelperFunction: user input validation + calls to reference engine
    - mcochatbotConvHandler: manages API calls, connects with API gateway to receive user inputs and forwards them to Lex in order to manage these inputs and generate responses
    - referenceEngineHandler: using kendra searches for a reference that matches the user active service input. Then extracts the information from the suggested first document and returns it to SageMaker, which connects with a Summarisation HuggingFace model to obtain a summary. Finally, the function responds with the summary and some other related information.
    - mcochatbotIntentCreator: this function creates a new intent and slot type based on the name and sample utterances for the new service
- Services folder: contains other resources used in AWS services.
    - kendra: contains synonyms thesaurus file for enhanced search.

Remarks: the only function directly connected to amplify is mcochatbotConvHandler. The other functions are directly deployed in lambda.
